<!-- In CSS, the z-index property is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements. When elements overlap on a web page, the z-index property determines which element appears on top of the others. Elements with a higher z-index value are displayed on top of elements with a lower z-index value.

Here's how it works:

Default Stacking Order:

Elements are rendered in the order they appear in the HTML document. Elements defined later in the document are drawn on top of elements defined earlier.
Positioned Elements:

The z-index property only affects positioned elements. Elements with a position value other than static (which is the default) can have a z-index value applied.
Z-Index Values:

z-index values can be positive, negative, or zero.
Elements with a higher z-index are stacked above elements with lower z-index.
If two elements have the same z-index, the stacking order is determined by their position in the HTML document.
Here's an example of how you might use the z-index property in CSS: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
            .e1 {
                position: absolute;
                z-index: 1;
                height: 30px;
                width: 30px;
                border: 2px solid black;
            }
            .e2 {
                height: 30px;
                width: 30px;
                border: 2px solid black;
            }
            .e3 {
                position: absolute;
                z-index: 1;
                height: 30px;
                width: 30px;
                border: 2px solid black;
            }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="e1">1</div>
        <div class="e2">2</div>
        <div class="e3">3</div>
