<!-- Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative Positioning

The difference between absolute and relative positioning in web development lies in how elements are placed within a document or a container. When an element is set to 'absolute' positioning, it is positioned in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block, which is usually the body element. This takes the element out of the regular document flow, meaning it doesn't affect the position of other elements. Instead, it can be precisely placed using the 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left' properties.

On the other hand, 'relative' positioning keeps the element within the document flow, meaning it still occupies space as it normally would. When an element is given 'relative' positioning, it is positioned relative to its default position. It doesn't affect the positioning of other elements, but you can adjust its position using the same 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left' properties.

Understanding these positioning techniques is crucial for creating responsive and well-organized layouts in web development, allowing developers to control the placement of elements with precision and flexibility. -->
